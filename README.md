# ChromeBookLinux
Utilities for using the Linux bits on a chromebook

The first utility is a shell script do setup a Chrome Book running the new Linux Containers to WOrk for a dotnet developer

```sh
Git Clone https://github.com/nickbeau/ChromeBookLinux
CD ChromeBookLinux
chmod 777 dotnet.sh
sudo ./dotnet.sh
```

And you are done :) - dotnetcore and VS Code all ready to go.

Just then run code.
